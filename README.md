# GetRandomWords
This calls the RandomWordAPI and gets a string of random words and combines them.  Intent is to create mostly random passwords IAW XKCD 936


This uses the API at the following link: https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home

The author of this repo has not confirmed the safety of this api, it is a third party API.  Use at your own risk.

The intent of this project is to give a combined password of multiple, randomly chosen words.  The author acknowledges that publicy creating "password creators" allows hackers to better guess passwords and doesn't really make security better.  

The author also acknowledges that spending an hour on an API caller to get random words is absolutely less efficient than googling "random word generator".  Oh well
